You can find a complete list of the courses I have taught, and their corresponding course materials, on my Teaching page.\nMy research focuses on developing and applying statistical methods to answer questions about human health and genetics. Read more about current and past projects on my Research page.\nI enjoy talking with students about research, graduate programs, and career opportunities in (bio)statistics.

    "text": "My research focuses on developing and applying statistical methods to answer questions about human health and genetics. Most recently, my work has focused on genetic studies in admixed populations—populations with mixed and diverse ancestry such as African Americans and Hispanics/Latinos—which have been vastly underrepresented in genetics research to date. For example, one of my recent projects developed methods and a corresponding R package (the latter of which has involved collaboration with Macalester students) for controlling for multiple testing in genome-wide admixture mapping studies.\nMethodologically, I am particularly interested in addressing the statistical challenges posed by genetic data, such as their high dimensional nature, sparsity, and complicated correlation structure, as well as concerns about confounding and collider bias that can arise in these studies. In general, I strive to ensure that my applied and methodological work is grounded in a deep understanding of the context (scientific, ethical, etc.) surrounding the data with which I am working. This often involves close collaboration with experts in other disciplines and, whenever possible, undergraduate students."
