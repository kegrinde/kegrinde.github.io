    "text": "Hello! Welcome to my website.\nMy name is Kelsey Grinde (KELL-see GRIN-dee) and I use the pronouns she/her/hers. I am a biostatistician and Assistant Professor of Statistics at Macalester College in St. Paul, Minnesota. I am originally from the Twin Cities and am happy to back as of 2019.\nBefore coming to Macalester, I spent five years in Seattle pursuing my PhD in Biostatistics at the University of Washington. My interest in statistics was first inspired by wonderful professors at St. Olaf College, where I pursued a BA in mathematics.\nI can also thank St. Olaf for introducing me to my spouse, Zack: we met on the intramural soccer field. (Coincidentally, my parents also met playing soccer at St. Olaf.) I am a lifelong soccer player and fan, and this continues to be one of my favorite ways to spend time outside of work. In what’s left of my free time, I also enjoy trying new restaurants, breweries, and coffee shops around the Twin Cities, listening to local radio station The Current, and traveling. The picture on this page is from a February 2024 trip to Fiordland National Park in New Zealand."

    "text": "My primary research interests are in the areas of biostatistics and statistical genetics. Most recently, my work has focused on developing and applying statistical methods for genetic studies in admixed populations—populations with mixed and diverse ancestry such as African Americans and Hispanics/Latinos—which have been vastly underrepresented in genetics research to date. For example, one of my recent projects developed methods and a corresponding R package (the latter of which has ongoing involved collaboration with Macalester students) for controlling for multiple testing in genome-wide admixture mapping studies.\nMethodologically, I am particularly interested in addressing the statistical challenges posed by genetic data, such as their high dimensional nature, sparsity, and complicated correlation structure, as well as concerns about confounding and collider bias that can arise in these studies. In general, I strive to ensure that my applied and methodological work is grounded in a deep understanding of the context (scientific, ethical, etc.) surrounding the data with which I am working. This often involves close collaboration with experts in other disciplines and, whenever possible, undergraduate students."
