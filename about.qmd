## Personal

My name is pronounced KELL-see GRIN-dee (click [this link](https://namedrop.io/kelseygrinde) to listen to me pronounce my name) and I use the pronouns she/her/hers. 
I live in St. Paul, Minnesota with my husband, Zack. 
I am originally from Minnesota (I grew up in Plymouth, a suburb of Minneapolis) and am  happy to back in the Twin Cities as of 2019.

In my free time, I enjoy:

- playing and watching soccer 
- trying new restaurants, breweries, and coffee shops around the Twin Cities
- listening to local radio station [The Current](https://www.thecurrent.org/)
- traveling, especially when it involves hiking (the picture on this page is from a February 2024 trip to Fiordland National Park in New Zealand)
