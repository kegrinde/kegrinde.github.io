<td align="left"><p>I am currently an Assistant Professor of Statistics in the <a href="https://www.macalester.edu/mscs/">Department of Mathematics, Statistics, and Computer Science</a> at <a href="https://www.macalester.edu/">Macalester College</a>. </p>
<p>At Macalester, I teach classes ranging across all levels of our undergraduate statistics curriculum, from introductory statistics to upper-level statistical theory. Statistics is an inherently collaborative, interdisciplinary field, and I love how this is reflected in the makeup of student backgrounds and interests in our statistics courses at Macalester.</p>
<p>My research interests fall into the realms of statistical genetics and biostatistics. Currently, my work focuses on developing statistical methods for genetic studies in <i>admixed populations</i>, populations such as African Americans and Hispanics/Latinos with mixed and diverse ancestry, which have been <a href="https://www.nature.com/news/genomics-is-failing-on-diversity-1.20759">vastly underrepresented</a> in genetics research. My most recent first-author paper develops methods for controlling for multiple testing in admixture mapping studies: check out my paper in the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajhg.2019.01.008">American Journal of Human Genetics</a> and my R package <a href="https://github.com/kegrinde/STEAM">STEAM (Significance Threshold Estimation for Admixture Mapping)</a> to learn more, and stay tuned for improvements to the STEAM package that are currently being implemented by my awesome student, <a href="https://github.com/zuofuhuang">Zuofu Huang</a>. </p>
<p>I love talking to current and prospective students about research, graduate programs, and careers in (bio)statistics. If you are a student (or educator) who would like to learn more about the opportunities in this field&#8201;&mdash;&#8201;and why I love working in it&#8201;&mdash;&#8201;please get in touch! I can best be reached via email (kgrinde at macalester dot edu). For those thinking about grad school, here are <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1wFTzt58C2ajQDycrpa6lSuetHdyVZG36GfLgTiCqJ1w/edit?usp=sharing">some slides</a> from a talk I gave about grad school at <a href="https://www.causeweb.org/usproc/eusrc/2020/program">eUSR 2020</a>.</p>
