I am an Assistant Professor of Statistics in the [https://www.macalester.edu/mscs/ Department of Mathematics, Statistics, and Computer Science] at [https://www.macalester.edu/ Macalester College]. Statistics is an inherently collaborative, interdisciplinary field, and I love how this is reflected in the makeup of student backgrounds and interests in our statistics courses at Macalester.

My research interests fall into the realms of statistical genetics and biostatistics. Currently, my work focuses on developing statistical methods for genetic studies in /admixed populations/, populations such as African Americans and Hispanics/Latinos with mixed and diverse ancestry, which have been [https://www.nature.com/news/genomics-is-failing-on-diversity-1.20759 vastly underrepresented] in genetics research. My most recent first-author paper develops methods for controlling for multiple testing in admixture mapping studies: check out my paper in the [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajhg.2019.01.008 American Journal of Human Genetics], my R package [https://github.com/kegrinde/STEAM STEAM (Significance Threshold Estimation for Admixture Mapping)], and the faster version of this package [https://github.com/GrindeLab/STEAMcpp STEAMcpp] created by my former student, [https://www.linkedin.com/in/zuofu-huang-588341180 Zuofu Huang]. 

I enjoy talking to current and prospective students about research, graduate programs, and careers in (bio)statistics. If you are a student who would like to learn more about the opportunities in this field---and why I love working in it---please get in touch (kgrinde ag macalester dot edu) and/or check out the resources below:

I contributed some reflections and tips on applying for jobs at liberal arts colleges, and there is also great advice from others on applying for other types of jobs.
